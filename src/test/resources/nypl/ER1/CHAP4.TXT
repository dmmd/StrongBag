   ...even if officially Mexico is considered just another country in not
being granted special treatment in matters of trade, the truth is that
North American leaders will be obligated to take into consideration
other elements of their relationship with Mexico.  Olga Pellicer de
Brody, 1981.

   As the world's thirteenth largest economy and the largest market
economy trading country still outside the GATT, Mexico's decision was
of great significance to the international trading system.  Report of
the working party on the accession of Mexico to the GATT, 1986.

   ...many of Mexico's exports to the United States, particularly
agricultural and mineral products, have to surmount high trade barriers
and arbitrary policies that protect special U.S. interests.  In contrast,
Mexico has erected no such barriers against imports from the United
States, which tend increasingly to be capital equipment and food, nor
are there measures that discriminate against the United States in
relation to other suppliers.  Victor L. Urquidi, 1979. 

                                      versus

   ...Mexico has utilized ... combinations of tariffs and surcharges,
quotas and restrictive licensing practices, artificial valuation schemes,
and a variety of export performance requirements and incentives... 
these policies have discriminated against the U.S. and Canada.  North
American Trade Agreements study mandated by section 1104 of the
U.S. trade agreements act of 1979, released in 198l. 


New Policy Directions
   U.S. policy for most of the period since World War II has been to reduce
trade barriers, while Mexico's commercial policy has been replete with import
restrictions.  The direction of each is now changing, that of the United States
toward greater protectionism and of Mexico toward more openness.  U.S.
protectionism is largely of a contingent nature, reacting to what are considered
unfair practices by others.  Mexican policy is shifting away from quantitative
restrictions in favor of tariffs for most items.  While the tariff levels are still
high, they are negotiable.  The Mexican intention to follow through on the
policy of greater openness is exemplified by accession to the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
   The United States has been the driving force behind the trade liberalization
that took place after World War II under the aegis of the GATT.  In successive
rounds of multilateral trade negotiations, tariffs of industrial countries were
drastically lowered and became a subordinate feature of trade in manufactures
among these countries.  Quantitative import restrictions were removed on most
nonagricultural commodities and a stab was made at dealing with other types of
nontariff barriers in the Tokyo round of trade negotiations during the 1970s. 
The United States sparked the effort begun at Punta del Este in 1986 to deal
with trade in agricultural products and services in the so-called Uruguay round
of GATT negotiations.  
   U.S. trade policy has not been pure.  The objective of U.S. policy has not
been absolutely free trade, but freer trade.  Free trade was a limit that might
some day be within grasp, but there was never a timetable.  Raymond Vernon
caught the essence of U.S. practice when he observed that the general policy
favored trade liberalization, even though specific cases of protectionism were
common.  Many protective measures were the price that different U.S.
administrations paid to particular interests to obtain a political consensus in
favor of the liberal general policy.  There are numerous examples of this: both
Presidents Kennedy and Nixon restricted textile imports at the same time they
undertook new multilateral rounds of trade negotiations; and the free entry of
commodities into the United States under President Reagan's Caribbean basin
initiative was circumscribed by many exceptions.  
   What has happened during the 1980s is that the weight of specific restrictions
has increased so much that the general policy of liberalization has been brought
into question.  The slogan has become fair trade as opposed to free or freer
trade.  Another catch phrase is the need for a level playing field, which argues
that since other countries intervene in a variety of ways to rig trade, the
United States must respond.
   Various other reasons have been given for this change in policy emphasis. 
These include the large U.S. trade deficits, the decline in many basic industries,
high unemployment among workers in declining industries, the emergence of many
new competitors among the newly-industrializing countries (NICs), the slowdown
beginning in the 1960s of U.S. productivity growth, and, for many years, the
overvaluation of the dollar.  
   Whatever the reasons, the United States is no longer the bulwark of freer
trade, except as this suits the nation, as in services and parts of agriculture. 
The change has made a major difference on the world scene - no other country
has replaced the United States as a leader for international trade liberalization.
   Mexico, by contrast, embarked on a policy of substantial import protection in
the post World-War II period, inspired by the country's underdevelopment and
the conviction among officials that opening domestic markets in these
circumstances was tantamount to accepting perpetual exploitation by wealthier,
predatory countries.  The theoretical development literature of the times,
especially during the 1950s, stressed industrialization as the path to development
and protection and import substitution as the means to industrialize.  Most of
Mexico's restrictive import measures, those that lasted until the past couple of
years, were introduced during this period.  So were many stimulatory actions in
favor of industrialization.    Restrictions included import licensing, domestic-
content provisions, export demands on foreign investors; and there was a rash of
fiscal subsidies - these are the measures to which the U.S. government was
referring in the final headnote to this chapter.  They will be discussed in
greater detail in chapter 5.
   This structure of protection and subsidy is now being dismantled under the
pressure of events.  The manifestations of this dismantling are the removal of
the requirement for prior import licenses for most commodities, accession to the
GATT, commitments to the World Bank to liberalize the trade regime, and the
reduction of fiscal subsidies.  
   The role reversal could not be more stark.  In its search for modernity,
Mexico is becoming a freer trading nation.  One must repeat that the operative
word is freer, not free; and in becoming more free, Mexico starts from a
relatively high protective position.  Unlike what was once the case in the United
States, no responsible figures in Mexico talk of free trade as some limit.  But
the direction of Mexican trade policy since 1982 has been clear -- it is toward
greater freedom.
   The direction of U.S. trade policy in the 1980s is also clear -- it is toward
greater protection.   Though the United States is still vastly more open to
imports than Mexico, there now exists the possibility that the two policy lines
will cross.  This is the backdrop to the trade discussion in this chapter, which
will examine both the historic and currently evolving interaction between the
two markets.  The interesting operational question relates to the growth in trade
integration that will occur between Mexico and the United States.
   Increasing its exports has now become a crucial element of Mexico's economic
development strategy.  The critical export market, more now than ever before, is
the United States.  The success of Mexico's new development policy, even if not
explicitly stated, is based on the country's interdependence with the United
States.

The Interaction of Two Policies

   The United States opted after World War II to make its trade policy truly
multilateral. GATT was organized at the instigation of the United States and
other industrial countries and it, rather than bilateral discussions, became the
forum for U.S. trade negotiations with other countries.  The U.S. devotion to
multilateralism was more complete than that of most developed countries and
bilateral agreements which existed with Cuba, the Philippines, and Venezuela
were allowed to lapse.  But multilateralism was never absolute; bilateralism, for
example, was used to obtain reciprocal results in trade with the state-trading
countries of Eastern Europe.
   However, alongside the multilateral structure, special arrangements grew
among the countries in the European Economic Community and the European
Free Trade Association, and then in the free-trade arrangement between the EEC
and EFTA.  The EEC set up a vast network of special arrangements with former
colonies of the member countries. European countries concluded an array of
bilateral agreements, although many were nothing more than political expressions
of intent with little bite with respect to imports and exports.
   It can be argued that the U.S. position of sticking to multilateralism while
special arrangements flourished around the world was naive.  U.S. dedication to
multilateralism, at least in trade relations with market economies, had
implications, too, for a special relationship with Mexico.  A special relationship
implies departures from general rules in favor of particular countries, whereas
pure multilateralism implies no such departures.  This tension between principle
and potential special practice in U.S. trade relations has always concerned
Mexican officials and, if truth be known, they never understood it.  The
writings of many Mexicans make it clear that Mexico would have entertained a
bilateral arrangement with the United States as long as this involved mostly one-
way benefits in favor of Mexico.  There was no bilateral agreement -- not until
1985, by which time a host of other international developments led to changes in
U.S. trade practices.  
   A related U.S. trade principle that affected relations with Mexico was the
most-favored-nation (MFN) clause.  MFN is another way of saying non-
discrimination, that all countries are treated as well as the country that is most
favored.  Unconditional MFN is the first principle of the GATT, set forth in
article I.  Unconditional MFN and multilateralism logically go together;  if there
is no discrimination in treatment of countries, there is no trade reason for
special bilateral agreements.
   This absolute consistency has not prevailed on the world scene. 
Unconditional MFN and bilateralism have gone hand in hand.  And so has special
treatment as an exception to the unconditional MFN clause.  Special treatment is
what general systems of preference give to the generality of developing
countries;  and it is what is done for limited groups of developing countries in
the agreements between the EEC and the ACP (Africa-Caribbean-Pacific)
countries and between the United States and countries in the Caribbean basin. 
Mexico, despite its location in the Caribbean basin, is not a beneficiary of the
special preferences of this last initiative. 
   One argument made by Victor Urquidi in the quotation at the beginning of
this chapter is that Mexico did not discriminate against the United States in
relation to other foreign countries in its trade restrictions.  This is overtly true,
but Mexico did try to use its oil exports to give and obtain concessions in
special bilateral agreements during the Lopez Portillo administration.  These
marked a departure from multilateralism, but not a significant one.  But even
though Mexico was not a member of the GATT until 1986, the two countries did
grant each other MFN treatment.
   The difference between the two trade policies was based on their disparate
degrees of development.  The United States found itself a world power in the
post-World War II period.  It sought to lead in both economic and security
matters, and dedicated itself to avoiding the mistakes of the interwar period
while at the same time seeking to maintain the international economic status
quo.  Mexico, by contrast, saw little merit in the status quo.  It saw
development of its own industry as the key to its modernization, using its
domestic market as the base to accomplish this.
   Trade conflict between the United States and Mexico was inevitable as a
result of these two world  views.  As long as both countries prospered, as was
the case until the 1970s, the conflict was muted.  What has brought trade
disputes into sharp focus in recent years has been the deterioration in the U.S.
trade account and the conviction of many domestic critics of U.S. trade policy
that this was due partially to fatuousness in rigid adherence to principle; and, on
Mexico's side, the protracted economic crisis of the 1980s.  Each country has a
tendency to blame the other.  The United States sees Mexico as a country that
uses a variety of techniques to deny U.S. producers a "level playing field." 
Mexico, in turn, sees the United States as imposing protective measures that
complicate Mexican emergence from its economic difficulties. 

                            The Bilateral Trade Picture
   Table 4.1 gives Mexican exports by main destinations and shows the
dominance of the United States.  The recent pattern is for 50 to 70 percent of
Mexican exports, by value, to go to the United States.  The decline toward the
low end of this percentage range in the early 1980s reflects growing oil exports
and the 50 percent limitation placed by Mexico on these exports to any one
country.  As oil revenue declined both absolutely and as a proportion of total
exports after 1982, the relative importance of the U.S. market increased.  
   This is a significant point.  The market for crude oil is worldwide and the
proportions traded between countries reflect location and business arrangements
rather than a complete range of competitive conditions.  Between 1980 and 1984,
the United States absorbed 78 percent of Mexico's nonoil exports, a truer
measure of Mexican dependence on the U.S. market.  Since Mexico sees its
future as a middle-level industrial power and a country with a diversified export
base, the 78 percent figure is more significant than the 57 percent of all
exports, including oil, to the United States over this period. 
        Table 4.2 shows Mexican imports from all sources.  The United States
once again dominates the picture.  But since a large proportion (about 50
percent) of nonoil U.S.- Mexican trade takes place between affiliates of U.S.
multinational corporations (MNCs), it is hard to disentangle the import and
export sides of the trade relationship.  The same company buys and sells to
itself through its affiliates in the two countries.  Many Mexican exports to the
United States under these circumstances are made possible by U.S. exports to                  Table 4.1  Mexican Exports by Main Destinations,

5Figures for 1970 and 1975 are imports from all of Asia.Mexico.  The inseparability between imports and exports is apt to become even
more significant in the future as trade in components rather than finished
products grows; much of this intra-industry trade implies two-way movement of
the same products, with value added at each move.  This is a significant
indicator of how thoroughly the two economies are becoming integrated in that
an ever-growing proportion of trade in manufactures is based on component
production by affiliated companies located in the two countries.
   By 1980, Mexico had become the third most important market for U.S.
exports, after Canada and Japan.  This position slipped in 1983 and 1984 as
Mexico drastically curtailed its imports, but has since been regained.  The
asymmetry in trade importance is evident in that even in third place, the
Mexican market normally accounts for between 5.5 and 6.5 percent of the value
of all U.S. exports, compared to ten times this reliance by Mexico on the U.S.
market.  Mexico in recent years has been the fourth source for U.S. imports,
accounting for more than 6 percent when oil prices were high and about 5.5
percent when they were lower.  
   Manufactured goods made up 79.5 percent of U.S. exports to Mexico in 1985. 
About half of total U.S. exports by value that year were machinery and transport
equipment.  About 37 percent of U.S. imports from Mexico in 1985 were crude
petroleum and more than 41 percent when other fuels and lubricants are added. 
Manufactures were 47 percent of U.S. imports from Mexico in 1985 and
agricultural products 9 percent.  The three leading manufactured U.S. imports
from Mexico in 1985 were automotive parts, especially piston engines; ignition
wiring sets; and chassis and bodies.  Automotive parts, including engines, were
also among the leading U.S. exports to Mexico.  This two-way trade illustrates
the extent of market integration that exists in this industry.
   Table 4.3 summarizes the overall merchandise trade balance between the two 
countries as it has evolved since 1970.  The trade balance showed a U.S. surplus
until 1981; since then the surplus has shifted to the Mexican side, propelled less
by increased U.S. imports than by drastic declines for several years in U.S.
exports to Mexico caused by the latter's stabilization program designed to deal
with the balance-of-payments crisis.

                                Particular Programs
   Table 4.4 lists imports from Mexico under the U.S. general system of
preferences (GSP).  The data show that as Mexico's oil exports diminished after
1984, utilization of GSP increased.  In 1980, during the heyday of Mexican oil
exports, GSP imports from Mexico were 4 percent of total U.S. imports from
Mexico.  In 1986, GSP imports made up 7.4 percent of the total.  This trend is
supported by other U.S. data which show Mexico's utilization rate increasing
from 50.7 to 52.2 percent from 1984 to 1985.  The utilization rate measures
those imports that enter duty free as a percentage of all products from a
country eligible for duty-free treatment under GSP.  Even at 52.2 percent, the
Mexican utilization rate is low; the average for all countries in 1985 was 77
percent.  For some reason -- perhaps the anti-export mentality that existed
for so long -- Mexico failed to take full advantage of the opportunities offered
by the U.S. GSP program.  Despite the low utilization rate, Mexico ranked fourth
in 1985 among foreign providers to the United States under GSP.
   Imports from Mexico under GSP cover a range of products.  The most
important categories are chemicals and related products, followed by machinery
and equipment, agriculture and fisheries, and some textiles and apparel.  Between
1976, when GSP was instituted in the United States, and 1985, duties foregone
on GSP imports from Mexico are estimated at $300 million.  By now, this
figure exceeds $350 million.
   GSP, while welcomed by Mexican authorities, has not been accepted without
criticism.  Gustavo del Castillo has asserted that hundreds of millions of dollars
of Mexican GSP-eligible exports are eliminated by U.S. customs authorities
because of improper documentation.  Isabel Molina has argued that in the 1984
renewal, GSP was made more protectionist.  The evidence supports this
observation, certainly for a newly-industrializing country (NIC) like Mexico.  In
January 1987, GSP benefits to the NICs, including Mexico, were further limited. 
Because of the nature of its exports, Mexico is one of the lesser beneficiaries of
GSP in terms of the proportion of trade that is theoretically eligible.  The most
significant export for which GSP is not relevant is petroleum.  Finally, more
Mexican products, involving more trade, have been graduated out of GSP
eligibility than for Brazil, the other large GSP beneficiary in Latin America. 
The main reason for this is that Mexican products were becoming increasingly
competitive with U.S. production.  Among the items excluded by graduation,
which is an administrative rather than a statutory exclusion, are beer and other
beverages, various vegetables, ceramic tiles, polyvinyl chloride resins, ferrites,
parts of piston engines, silver articles, elevator winches, lead-acid storage
batteries, transceivers, toys, and springs and leaves for motor-vehicle
suspension.
   GSP, as noted above, is a departure from the unconditional MFN provision of
the GATT, although specifically sanctioned by the Contracting Parties.  It is a
one-way grant of free entry for products chosen by the importing country in
favor of exporting developing countries designated as beneficiaries.  The original
U.S. statute provided that a country lost GSP eligibility for a specific product
under two so-called competitive-need provisions: if U.S. imports from that

country in the previous year exceeded 50 percent of all imports of that product;
and if the value of imports exceeded a specific dollar value.   The 1984
revision altered the competitive-need provisions by removing them for the least-
developed beneficiary countries, maintaining them for a middle tier of countries,
and permitting the imposition of harsher terms (to 25 percent instead of 50
percent of U.S. imports of a specific tariff item) for the most developed of the
beneficiary countries.  Mexico fits into this last category and this was the basis
given for the exclusions announced on January 2, 1987.  Countries can also be
graduated completely out of U.S. GSP when per capita income exceeds $5,000, a
figure high enough so that Mexico is in no immediate danger of losing eligibility
on this ground. 
   Graduation has been the most controversial aspect of GSP in Mexico. 
Discretionary U.S. decisions on graduation are based on a combination of
political pressures from Mexico and from competing U.S. producers.  The fact
that GSP imports amount to only about 7 percent of all U.S. imports from
Mexico, or about 15 percent of nonoil imports, is not a convincing argument to a
U.S. producer facing product-specific competition from Mexico.  Enough
discretionary cases have gone against Mexico for it to doubt its political weight
in these internal U.S. deliberations.  The restrictive actions of January 1987
made it evident that the United States is serious about graduation.  The main
impact so far has been on six countries; Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Mexico, and Brazil.
   Mexico nonetheless benefits from GSP's existence, although it is hard to
measure by how much.  An even less measurable aspect of GSP is the weight its
existence has when nonrelated import restrictions are imposed on Mexican
products.  As one hand of the United States gives a GSP benefit, the other feels
justified in imposing a restriction.  
   Table 4.5 shows U.S. imports from Mexico under U.S. tariff items 806.30 and
807.00.   These two tariff items represent another special form of U.S. imports. 
These imports come from what are known as maquiladora, or assembly plants in
Mexico, most of which are near the U.S. border.  The maquiladora will be
discussed in greater detail in chapter 8, but the trade implications will be taken
up now.  The maquiladora plants represent a heightened form of production
sharing under which components of manufactured goods are produced in the
United States and then shipped to Mexico for further elaboration, especially to
take advantage of cheap labor.
   TSUS (tariff schedules of the United States) items 806.30 and 807.00 exclude
from liability for duty the U.S. portion of the value of certain imported articles. 
Item 806.30 deals with metal products and 807.00, which is by far the more
important, with other commodities.  Put differently, the tariff on entry into the
United States under 806.30/807.00 is imposed only on the value added abroad. 
This is the significance of the different columns of table 4.5.  Column 1 includes
the value of the U.S. goods originally sent to Mexico; column 2, on which the
duty is levied, shows the value added in Mexico.  From the Mexican viewpoint,
therefore, column 2 is the relevant indicator of trade benefit.  About 50 percent
of U.S. 806.30/807.00 imports from Mexico constitute value added in Mexico. 
Most of this value added is labor.
   As table 4.5 shows, 806.30/807.00 imports from Mexico have increased steadily
since 1980.  The most important 806.30/807.00 imports from Mexico are machinery
and equipment.  They made up 85 percent of all 806.30/807.00 imports from
Mexico in 1985 on a gross basis and 52 percent of the dutiable value.  The  
products involved were mostly parts for television, electronic and electrical

equipment, office machines, and transportation equipment, although some  final
products were also imported.  The second most important product category was
textiles, apparel, and footwear.  The textile and apparel items imported under
807.00 are included in the quota limitations imposed against Mexico under the
multifiber arrangement (MFA).
   Imports benefiting from the terms of 806.30/807.00 apply to all countries,
developed and developing alike, and the system was not devised solely to benefit
Mexico.  The dutiable proportion from other countries in 1985 was 75 percent of
gross 806.30/807.00 imports, a percentage considerably higher than the roughly 50
percent from Mexico.  This means that a greater relative value of U.S.
componentry was incorporated in 806.30/807.00 imports from Mexico than from
the rest of the world.  This can be seen also in the fact that Mexico in 1985
provided 18 percent of gross U.S. imports under 806.30/807.00, but only 11
percent of the dutiable imports.
   This point has relevance for the future of 806.30/807.00 as it applies to
Mexico.  U.S. labor unions dislike these provisions of the U.S.tariff schedule out
of conviction that they encourage industries to run away to take advantage of
cheap labor.  When the U.S. Tariff Commission, the predecessor to the U.S.
International Trade Commission (USITC), studied this question in 1970, it
concluded that 806.30/807.00, on balance, helped create U.S. jobs to provide the
components for further processing abroad and for servicing the imports and
exports.  The implied alternative to 806.30/807.00 was the loss to other countries
of the entire operation.  Because the use of 806.30/807.00 increased dramatically
after 1970, the USITC was asked once again to study the issue of job loss and
its conclusion in 1988 was similar to that of 1970.  It is also clear that more
U.S. componentry, and hence U.S. jobs, are used in the Mexican maquiladora
than in comparable assembly operations in the rest of the world.  
   For Mexico, the maquiladora are a source of benefit and problems.  Their
existence in Mexico, coupled with the operation of 806.30/807.00 on the U.S.
side, means that foreign-exchange earnings from domestic value added in Mexico
are 10 percent above what is shown in the merchandise trade account.  (The
value added from maquiladora is not included in the trade account in Mexico's
balance-of-payments presentation, but rather elsewhere in the current account.) 
The problems relate to the enclave nature of the maquiladora, social issues
connected with female employment in these factories, environmental degradation
from some plants, and the uncertain nature of an operation that is as mobile as
most assembly plants.  These issues are dealt with in chapter 8.

                            Mutual Trade Restrictions 
   For many years, Mexican import restrictions against U.S. products were far
greater than U.S. limits on imports from Mexico.  The changing trade policy in
Mexico leading to reduced import barriers is based on the expectation that less
protection -- and hence lower production costs -- will lead to expanded exports. 
Mexico is now joining the rest of the trading world more fully than at any time
since the revolution.  And for Mexico, the trading world is represented
overwhelmingly by the United States.  Any significant growth in U.S. restrictions
on imports from Mexico would thus frustrate the accomplishment of Mexico's
economic development objectives.  The United States cannot divorce its trade
policy toward Mexico from the overall interdependence of the two countries.
   There are many U.S. restrictions against imports from Mexico, but the damage
is still more potential than actual.  For a long time, a key Mexican complaint
concerned the escalation of the U.S. tariff structure.  Tariff rates increase as
products are further elaborated in order to protect domestic value added,
particularly labor.  Tariffs are low or nil for raw materials, in a middle range
for intermediate goods, and highest for final products.  The Mexican argument
was that protecting value added (labor) in the United States, limited Mexico's
own ability to add value (to use labor) in its exports to the United States.  But
the escalation issue is no longer significant because U.S. tariffs, as well as those
of other developed countries, have been reduced significantly in successive
rounds of GATT negotiations.  Nominal (stated) U.S. tariffs, weighted by imports,
are in the 4-7 percent range.
   Overt nontariff barriers on U.S. imports from Mexico now exist for textiles
and apparel and steel.  Sanitary regulations limit imports of fresh vegetables and
meat.  Border-crossing and customs regulations may act as a deterrent to
Mexican exports.  There are not enough bridges between the two countries in
the lower Rio Grande Valley.
   Both Mexico and the United States are parties to the multi-fiber arrangement
(MFA), under which international trade in textiles and apparel is regulated. 
Pursuant to the umbrella of the MFA, the United States and Mexico have
concluded a series of bilateral agreements which call for explicit quotas on some
items, which in 1985 accounted for 60 percent of the value of MFA-covered
imports from Mexico.  There are also provisions which permit the imposition of
quotas on additional items if imports are seen as disrupting or threatening the
U.S. market; consultations are triggered when imports reach designated levels. 
But this U.S. import restriction, because it is global in scope, is actually
probably a boon to Mexico.  To cite the USITC: "Mexico receives benefits from
the extremely tight quota restraints that are applied to the large Asian suppliers. 
As U.S. importers find it increasingly difficult to fill their needs from countries
such as Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan, export opportunities increase for a large
number of secondary suppliers, including Mexico."
   Following the submission of a number of unfair trade petitions against
Mexican steel exporters, Mexico in late 1984 agreed to limit steel exports to the
United States and the U.S. government, in turn, agreed to seek the withdrawal
of the unfair-trade petitions.  The limits for 1986 for steel produced outside the
maquiladora framework were 0.36 percent of apparent U.S. consumption (compared
with 0.83 percent in 1984) and 100,000 tons of semi-finished steel.  This limit
was increased by 12.4 percent for 1988.    Nevertheless, Mexico was adversely
affected by the forced export limitation, but the limits placed on Mexican steel
exports should be seen in the context of U.S. restrictions on steel imports from
a number of providers.
   The principal U.S. nontariff barrier is what has come to be known as
contingent protection.  This refers to actual or threatened actions, mostly at
the initiative of U.S. producers facing foreign competition, to either limit
imports or impose supplemental duties on the grounds of what have come to be
known as unfair trade practices.  Such practices include foreign subsidies (that
is, government support to facilitate low export prices) or dumping (sales at less
than fair value, usually cost plus profit) by foreign producers.  Since U.S. tariffs
are low and legislatively-applied import quotas take much time to get approved
even when they are imposed, charges of unfairness -- contingent protection --
have become a popular protective device in the United States.  As seen by the
steel example, an unfair trade petition can result either in negotiating a
"voluntary" limitation by the exporting country or lead to a countervailing or
anti-dumping duty.
   Table 4.6 lists all the subsidy/countervailing duty cases in the United States
against Mexico between 1980 and 1986.
   Section 301 of the U.S. trade act of 1974, later amended in 1984, permits the
president to impose restrictions on imports if he concludes that foreign actions
deny benefits to the United States under any trade agreement or if foreign
practices are judged to be unjustifiable, unreasonable, or discriminatory.  This
is broad power indeed.  The authority of the 1974 law was expanded in 1984 by
extending the president's scope to deal with foreign barriers to trade in services
and denial of national treatment to U.S. investors.  The law contains procedures
for dispute settlement with the foreign government, including recourse to the
GATT if the issue is covered by the articles, but in the end permits the United
States to take unilateral action if a mutually acceptable solution is not found. 
In other words, it is contingent protection writ large, and therefore limits the
ability of producers who depend on exports to the United States to plan their
production with certainty.
   The most publicized unfair-trade case in recent years was that dealing with
Mexican fresh fruit and vegetable exports to the United States.  In 1985, fruit,
nut, and vegetable imports from Mexico amounted to $676 million.  In the
1984-85 U.S. crop year (November l, 1984 to October 31, 1985), about 70 percent
of Mexican fresh fruits and vegetables entered during the winter period,
November through April.  The main product is tomatoes, but others include
cucumbers, eggplant, onions, green peppers, squash, asparagus, broccoli,
cauliflower, okra, strawberries, cantaloupes, and grapes.  The Mexicans compete
during this winter period with production of Florida, California, and Texas, as
well as with cold-storage products.  In 1978, producers of Florida winter
vegetables submitted an anti-dumping case against the Mexican suppliers alleging
that they were selling produce at less than fair value.  This charge was
preliminarily rejected by the U.S. Treasury department in 1979 and then rejected
in a final determination by the U.S. Commerce department in 1980.  During
this two-year period, the export trade was made uncertain in that a decision
against Mexico would have resulted in increased duties, both prospectively and
retroactively.  The threat of renewed harassment is never absent.  
   The United States justifies contingent protection by charging that many
foreign trade practices are unfair.  Foreign suppliers in turn charge that
unfairness is charged quite promiscuously whenever they increase their position
in the U.S. market.  The very charge can disrupt trade by triggering a formal
investigation whose outcome is unknown; consequently, the level of duties that
will ultimately be levied is unknown.
   The issue is a difficult one.  Unfairness in the form of subsidies or dumping
often exists.  How one defines dumping can be a complex issue; in the winter

3When a subsidy is found, the determination establishes a past rate and estimates
  what deposit is needed to compensate for future subsidies.  The two rates are
  often the same.  The percentage shown is for the past subsidy.  CVD refers to
  the indicated countervailing duty to nullify the effect of the subsidy.
4Most subsidy cases are reviewed some time after the final determination and this may
  change the earlier determination.
5When a range for the CVD is shown, this is to capture the subsidy determination
  for different exporters.
6Suspended refers to agreement by producer/exporter to cease the subsidization.  The
  figure in parentheses is the rate of subsidy found that is being suspended.
7Termination refers to action taken before final determination.
8Various subsidy cases involving steel products were revoked after Mexico agreed
  to voluntarily restrain steel exports.
9This case lapsed after the U.S.-Mexican bilateral agreement was signed providing
  an injury test before the application of U.S. countervailing duties against
  Mexican subsidies.
vegetable case it hinged on whether sales of fresh vegetables at different prices
at varying periods after harvest were a prudent business measure to avoid
spoilage or predatory marketing.  It was clear until Mexico and the United
States signed a bilateral agreement in 1985 covering subsidy and countervailing
duty practices that it was open season on filing subsidy charges against imports
from Mexico since the mere existence of a subsidy, regardless of the degree of
injury it caused a U.S. producer, was enough to trigger a countervailing duty. 
This is evident from the large number of cases filed against Mexico between
1980 and 1986 (table 4.6).
   The U.S. Congress is probably the main generator of contingency protection
that Mexico must confront.  The Canadian ambassador to the United States has
pointed out that various types of U.S. legislative impulses can affect Canada:
legislation directed specifically at Canada; generalized legislation to protect
Americans against foreign trade practices; legislation directed inwardly, such as
to protect the environment, that affects foreign countries; and legislation put
forth by a single legislator that has an intended or unintended effect on
Canada.  The point of the observation is that Canada must be constantly alert
to protect itself.  So must Mexico and for the same reasons.
   This attention to legislative processes is necessary for all countries, but the
separation of powers makes U.S. protective practice especially unpredictable. The
unintended effects, moreover, are particularly strong for countries like Canada
and Mexico, because of their great dependence on the U.S. market.   What the
U.S. Congress deems mostly internal, such as marketing regulations for fresh
vegetables or a tax on petroleum to help finance the environmental superfund,
can have economic repercussions on Mexico. 
   Increasing U.S. protectionism is at the heart of the Mexican concern about
future trade between the two countries.  There is irony in this.  U.S. officials
have urged Mexico to open its market, arguing that this would make Mexican
products more competitive in export markets.  Mexico, for reasons of its own,
is now following this advice, really for the first time in any serious way since
the end of World War II.  However, as the new policy succeeds, individual
instances of U.S. protection are emerging in ever-increasing fashion, including
attacks against preferences for specific Mexican products, questioning the
validity of 806.30 and 807.00, forcing cutbacks in Mexican steel exports, and who
knows what else next.  Protectionist proposals made in the U.S. Congress are
limited only by the imaginations of congresspersons and their interested
constituents.
   For many years, Mexican authorities cried wolf about U.S. trade restrictions. 
The fear of contingent U.S. protection, however, now has roots in reality. 
Actual U.S. restrictions against imports from Mexico -- other than those on
health grounds -- are still relatively modest (certainly when compared with
Mexican restrictions), but recent tendencies give little ground for optimism.
    The U.S. complaint has not been that Mexican import policy has been
discriminatory, despite the quotation cited at the head of this chapter, but that
it has been excessively restrictive even for a developing country.  Specific U.S.
complaints generally respond to importunings from U.S. producers and therefore
usually reflect the reality of being locked out of or limited in entry to the
specific Mexican markets.  Yet, in a broader economic sense, the narrow charges
are simplistic.  There is no evidence that U.S. exports, measured in their
totality, were excluded from the Mexican market for reasons other than Mexico's
availability of foreign exchange.  This was evident from the consistent U.S.
surpluses in trade with Mexico before 1982.  What the Mexican import-
substitution process accomplished was to shift the composition of its imports, and
hence of U.S. exports, from consumer to intermediate and capital goods.  There
was not enough foreign exchange available for Mexico to have imported increased
consumer-goods along with other goods.  In the four to five years prior to the
crisis in its  balance of payments in 1982, increased total imports were based
largely on an excessive debt buildup, a policy that collapsed.
   Despite all the U.S. complaints, the restrictive Mexican import system really
favored the United States.  The imports curtailed by denial of licenses were
mostly consumer goods in which the United States was losing competitiveness. 
The imports encouraged, of intermediate goods and capital goods, were those in
which U.S. competitiveness endured longer.  The trade pattern fostered by
Mexico resulted in advantages for intra-industry trade and this benefited U.S.
producers because of their predominance among foreign investors in Mexico.  The
wisdom of Mexico's import-substitution policy can be questioned, but it is hard
to make a case on other than a product-by-product basis that U.S. exports to
Mexico were curtailed by the policy.

Lowering of Mexican Import Protection
   Before examining the steps taken by Mexico that are opening the economy to
foreign trade, recent development of Mexico's trade should be set forth because
they explain the motivations of the new policy.  Table 4.7 lists Mexican imports
by type of product.  The decline during the past 25 years in the proportion of
consumer goods in the total and the increase in intermediate products is evident. 
Yet, the data actually understate the decline in manufactured consumer goods
imports since a large proportion of what does enter Mexico under the

consumption-goods category consists of basic foodstuffs, primarily grains and
oilseeds.
   Table 4.8 shows Mexican exports by economic activity, and demonstrates first
the growth in importance of petroleum in total Mexican exports as prices
increased, then their decline when oil prices fell, especially in 1986.  The table
also shows the increase in manufactured exports, both absolutely and as a
proportion of total exports, since 1983.  Product diversification of exports came
less by choice than from necessity and the current import opening is designed to
make this export diversification permanent.   
   During the 1960s, the ratio between the growth of Mexican imports and the
growth in Mexican GDP was 0.85; that is, GDP growth was sustained without
swamping the country with imports (see Figure 4.1).  The ratio increased to 1.80
during the 1970s and then became explosively unpredictable in the 1980s.  The
increase in the ratio during the 1970s was caused by the rush to industrial
development during the Lopez Portillo administration.  Once oil prices declined,
the only resources that could sustain the import binge were from external debt
and this was not durable.  In 1982, imports declined by about 70 times the fall
in GDP and then by 13 times in 1983.  The Mexican economy was starved of
imports during these two years, but this could not be sustained indefinitely. 
Over time, the growing import demand must be met by growing exports.  This
explains the current export mentality.
   One final table dealing with the development of Mexico's balance of payments
is useful for understanding the Mexican foreign-exchange problem (table 4.9). 
The turnaround in the current account starting in 1982 reflects primarily the
change in the trade account.  But, just as the trade surplus could not be
sustained only on the basis of curtailed imports, the maintenance of a current                                    Figure 4.1

account surplus is tenuous because of large payments for interest on foreign
debt.  When the current account dips back into deficit, this implies an increase
in foreign borrowing.  The essential corrective to this situation is a growing
export surplus.  Table 4.9 brings out Mexico's large foreign borrowings in 1980
and 198l, shown in the capital account, and the substantial capital flight
beginning in 1980, part of which is reflected in errors and omissions.  Debt
issues will be covered more completely in chapter 7.
   The trade account has thus become an essential element of the Mexican
economic recovery.  It will allow the generation of a current-account surplus
necessary to meet debt-service payments without further debt buildup.  Continued
curtailment of imports would prejudice Mexico's industrial growth, since most
imports are industrial inputs, and this places the main burden on the export side
of the trade account.  These imperatives explain the shift in trade policy more
than all the importunings of the World Bank, the IMF, or the U.S. government. 
Though not all Mexicans accept this logic, preferring to believe there may be
renewed life in a reprise of development from within, the official policy is based
on a need to promote exports. 

                             The Trade Policy Changes
   Mexico formalized its accession to the GATT on July 24, 1986 and this
became effective one month later, making Mexico the 92nd contracting party.  
The decision was a significant one, both because of the commitments made in the
accession negotiations and the indications it gives of future trade policy.  The
promise of GATT membership is that Mexico will be more open to imports in the
future than in the past and that protection will take the form primarily of
tariffs rather than quantitative restrictions.  This is not necessarily assured
since the GATT Contracting Parties, in practice, give much leeway to developing
countries for departures from openness; but it makes little sense for Mexico to
have joined GATT with the intention of violating its very premises.
   Following detailed negotiations, Mexico decided at the eleventh hour to reject
accession in 1980.  The question therefore arises as to why the Mexican
authorities changed their collective mind in 1986.  The major reasons are
embodied in the trade and balance-of-payments data discussed earlier; they
demonstrate that the closed economic model was no longer viable.  Mexico did
not have the cushion of oil revenue in 1986 that in 1980 provided a false sense
of security to policy makers.  One Mexican analyst argued that the options open
to Mexico in 1986 were the status quo, bilateralism, or multilateralism, and he
rejected the first two as economically and politically infeasible.  The other
argument put forward by proponents of accession, such as Ricardo Pen~a Alfaro,
was that trade negotiations in a multilateral context improved Mexico's relative
power.
   When accession had been rejected six years earlier, one argument was that
membership would increase Mexico's dependence on the United States because of
the great U.S. influence in the GATT.   But Mexico's decision to distance
itself from the GATT and its instruments actually led to increased bilateralism
with the United States.  Mexico's lack of adherence to the code on subsidies
and countervailing duties led to the protective open season on Mexico noted
earlier, and forced the government to conclude a bilateral agreement under which
Mexico promised to alter its export subsidy practices in return for a U.S.
promise not to impose countervailing duties unless it could be demonstrated that
a U.S. industry was injured, or threatened with injury, from Mexican subsidies. 
What Mexico obtained bilaterally could have been acquired in a multilateral
framework under the GATT code on this subject.   
   The Pen~a Alfaro logic, that there is strength in developing country unity
inside the GATT, merits elaboration.  Trade bargaining takes place between
nations, regardless of their degree of economic integration, unless a country
completely isolates itself from the world, as Albania did for many years. 
Because of the extent of their de facto integration, bargaining between the
United States and Mexico, at governmental and extra-governmental levels, is
pervasive.  It is difficult to understand why the weaker country, Mexico, would
eschew membership in an organization with rules for certain types of trade
bargaining in favor of ad hoc negotiations without these explicit rules.  That, in
essence, was the consequence of the 1980 decision to stay out of the GATT.
   One final argument used by proponents of accession to the GATT was that
this was a way, perhaps the only way, to introduce coherence in Mexico's trade
policy.  Despite the evident weakness with the development-from-within model,
Mexico toyed in 1980-1982  with even greater import restrictions than already
existed.  The model was developed by a group of advisers from Cambridge
University, the Cambridge Policy Group, and called for direct and selective
import controls run by import boards, a reduction of interest rates, and
suspension of gradual depreciations of the peso.  The policy entailed even more
closing of the economy.  The Cambridge proposals coincided with the position of
some advisors to President Lopez Portillo and many of the recommendations
were, in fact, tried at the close of his administration in 1982.  Many of these
advisors remain active in Mexico and could once again become influential if the
current opening of the economy does not lead to favorable results.
   The structure of protection in Mexico was clearly not conducive to export
expansion.  In a study in 1984, the Instituto Mexicano de Comercio Exterior
(IMCE) demonstrated the dramatic growth in the bias against exports between
1979 and 1981 and then the gradual reduction in this bias because of the
currency depreciations starting in 1982.  IMCE makes the point that the
discretionary, case-by-case choice of protective levels for products discriminates
among  activities, whereas protection deriving from the exchange rate is uniform
across activities.  The main conclusion that can be drawn from the IMCE study
is that the discretionary determination of levels of protection, by product and
sector, coupled with the Mexican habit of maintaining an overvalued exchange
rate, not only led to disparities in levels of effective protection and effective
subsidies, but contributed to the noncompetitiveness of Mexican products.  This
conclusion was generally confirmed by separate analysis of what are known as
domestic resource cost ratios.
   We are now witnessing Mexico's first serious experiment with openness in
foreign trade in the post-World War II period.  In addition to the GATT
commitment, Mexico received a $500 million loan from the World Bank in 1986
whose objective was to liberalize the trade regime by phasing down nontariff
barriers and otherwise changing trade policy.  These changes are to take place
over a number of years and the bank stated explicitly that it contemplated a
series of loans over the 1986-1988 period pari passu with Mexican liberalization
performance.  The loans from the World Bank reinforce the decision to enter
GATT and thus strengthen the promise of trade reform.  

                   Political Implications of Trade Opening
   There are several reasons for uncertainty about the durability of Mexico's
trade opening.  The first is that it is a significant change from past policy and
wrenches of this magnitude in the way business is done are unsettling.  There
have been past liberalization efforts, none as ambitious as that currently under
way, and each foundered because of internal political opposition. 
   The more important reason to expect dissent about economic opening, really
an explanation of why trade liberalization is so controversial, is that the stakes
within the society are high.  A system of controlled imports, reinforced by an
overvalued exchange rate that makes it cheap to acquire foreign inputs, creates
a particular set of winners.  These include the protected industrialists, organized
labor in these industries, and the bureaucracy, both of the government and the
official party.  Protected Mexican industrialists and their workers had no reason
to fear external competition.  They were generally not productive enough to
export competitively, but the noncompetitive domestic market belonged to them
at their prices.  The official bureaucracy literally held life-and-death control
over industrial activities through its ability to make general rules regarding
imports, while also having discretion over individual decisions on import licenses
and duty exoneration.  The PRI can be seen as an extension of the official
bureaucracy.  Since organized labor has been strongest in unions of state-owned
enterprises, this gave the PRI another element of control, while benefiting the
workers involved.  
   There has been much debate in Mexico about the tendency to fill senior
positions in the government, including the presidency itself, by technicians as
opposed to politicians.  One aspect of this debate that is rarely articulated
clearly is that politicians would not be likely to open the Mexican economy,
since this involves loss of a major aspect of patronage and control, and that it
required the tecnicos first to liberalize the economy and now to keep it open. 
This may be the most significant aspect of the choice of Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, a tecnico, to succeed de la Madrid as president.
   Winners from an opening are hard to define precisely; and what winners there
are will depend on the success of the experiment.  If manufactured exports grow,
as they have since 1986, the constraint placed on the Mexican economy from the
balance of payments will be eased.  This is the main objective of the
liberalization.  Those producers able to compete internationally will be winners. 
And if the opening succeeds, the big winner will be Mexican labor as a whole --
those persons not affiliated with the protected or the government sector and
whose rewards lagged  in the protected model.  The Mexican consumer should
end up paying less for imported commodities, whether used directly or as inputs
into other goods.  The experiment, in short, deals with potential income shares,
a profound political issue over which revolutions and civil wars have been
fought.
   There is an equally far-reaching political-economic consequence of opening an
economy.  In an open economy, one in which the decision to import grows out
of price considerations rather than official discretion, the role of the
bureaucracy changes.  The bureaucracy will still control key aspects of the
import environment through the level of the tariff and manipulation of the
exchange rate, but this control will decline as the tariff is lowered -- provided
the exchange rate is not allowed to become overvalued, thereby losing its
function of protecting domestic producers against cheap imports.  The elimination
of case-by-case discretion over permission to import and the terms of this
import can be telling in reducing the scope for official corruption.  Flexible
rules breed corruption; general procedures under which price, not fiat, determines
outcomes remove this potential source of dishonesty.  Corruption will not
disappear in Mexico as trade is liberalized, but one important temptation will be
diminished.
   Finally, if trade liberalization is combined with diminution in the number of
enterprises operated by the state, key tools of political control and patronage
will be altered.  Under these circumstances, the very political process in Mexico
could be changed.  This is one aspect of the technician-politician debate.  There
would be reason to be skeptical about Mexico's continued dedication to trade
liberalization, subsidy reduction, and privatization -- all of which are stated
policy of the de la Madrid administration and of his chosen successor, Carlos
Salinas de Gortari -- should the politicians regain control of the state
machinery.
   Is trade liberalization reversible?  The answer is obviously yes, but the longer
the liberalization process endures, the harder it will be to change course once
again.  A new set of vested interests will have been established.  Just as it is a
trauma to shift from discretionary decisions to generalized price protection for
imports, so would it be traumatic to shift back again if the new rules become
entrenched.  
   The PRI is thus caught in an impossible position.  If the trade opening fails
to achieve its main objective of reducing the balance-of-payments constraint, the
PRI will take much of the blame as the party in power.  If the opening
succeeds, this will make irrelevant much of the bureaucratic machinery on which
the PRI relies for its strength.  This process will take at least a few years to
work itself out.  What is involved is not just trade policy, but the economic-
political ramifications of complex changes which have been set in motion.

Looking Ahead
   One should not overstate.  Mexico is opening its market, but the changes now
taking place will not create a completely open market.  Tariff levels will still be
relatively high and residual quantitative import restrictions  will still be
significant.  The durability of the process is uncertain.
   However, the direction in which Mexico is moving will tie its economy to
what is taking place in the world economy more than at any time in the last 50
years.  In view of the natural trade and industrial links with the United States,
the current policy will reinforce the economic integration that already exists
between the two countries.  This is understood by those Mexicans who oppose
the trade opening.  Mexico's failure to enter the GATT in 1980 required the
country to reach bilateral understandings with the United States, but Mexico's
trade opening, symbolized by entry into the GATT in 1986 is almost certain to
intensify economic relations with the United States even further.  This, too, is
clear to the Mexican authorities.
   Despite the GATT multilateralism, Mexico did conclude a so-called framework
trade agreement with the United States in November 1987 calling for negotiations
and consultations on a variety of trade issues, investment policy, and treatment
of intellectual property.  Both Mexico and the United States have decided that
their mutual interests are best served by a combination of multilateralism and
explicit bilateralism.  Both elements of the combination are new for Mexico and
the duality provides Mexico with multiple future options in its trade policy.
   There has been a secular tendency of the two economies to integrate and any
effort to alter this tendency would undoubtedly be costly in terms of reduced
Mexican economic growth.  The integration exists in factor markets -- for labor
and capital -- and is growing in product markets as well, as exemplified by
industrial complementarity and trade.    It occurred even during Mexico's period
of extreme import substitution and is likely to proceed even faster as this policy
is jettisoned.
