	INTRODUCTION
	The man who said it was impossible was interrupted by another 
	one who had just done it. If we miss this opportunity we won't 
	get another one for 20 years.
	
	
	CHAPTER 1. THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF AN FTA
	The FTA as the rallying point of a new political labor 
	initiative. Labor has positioned itself in combination with a 
	number of issues oriented groups (wildlife, toxic substances, 
	human rights etc.) to fight an FTA. The administration and 
	business strongly favor it. Is there a bargain to be struck 
	involving broader issues including safety standards and 
	environmental issues? 
	
	CHAPTER 2. MEXICO'S ECONOMY TODAY
	The 1980s, the debt crisis, the fall in real wages. 
	Modernization: deregulation, budget balancing, stabilization, 
	privatization, trade reform; political opening? Sustainable 
	reforms? Comparisons with Spain.
	
	
	CHAPTER 3  COSTS AND BENEFITS OF FREE TRADE WITH MEXICO
	After US and Mexican trade opening, what barriers are left? 
	Impact on trade of further opening. Impact on employment. Role 
	of FTA in strengthening Mexican reforms, building confidence. 
	Reflow of capital financing trade imbalances. 
	Effects on third countries in the Caribbean and Central 
	America. Effects on Outside Countries. Implications for on 
	Migration
	
	
	CHAPTER 4. THE FREE TRADE AGREEMENT AND MULTILATERALISM
	Tradition of GATT and the most favored nation treatment; GATT 
	rules, US-Canada and US-Israel as precedents. The European 
	experience. Example of Spain, example of Eastern Europe today. 
	The importance of Rules of Origin.
	
	CHAPTER 5. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
	Fast track. Comprehensiveness of coverage: trade, investment, 
	services. Accompanying issues:safety standards, adjustment 
	assistance, environmental issues.

	II. A MORE DETAILED PROPOSAL
	
	
	CHAPTER 1 THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF AN FTA 
		Thomas R. Donahue, Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO 
	told the Senate Finance Committee on February 6th, 1991: "The 
	enactment of a free trade agreement with Mexico, as proposed 
	by President Bush, would be an economic and social disaster 
	for U.S. workers and their communities, and do little to help 
	the vast majority of Mexican workers." 	A coalition of more 
	than 400 major corporations and trade association signed an 
	open letter strongly supporting a FTA. Congress is divided. 
	All of a sudden the proposed FTA has become a major domestic 
	policy issue in the United States.
		Mexican wage levels, lack of effective safety 
	standards and environmental safeguards in Mexico are raised by 
	opponents of an FTA. They argue that US firms will chose the 
	low wage option in preference to raising productivity and that 
	they woill flee from regulatory standards, leaving US workers 
	behind.  A coalition encompassing at least 20 different labor 
	and citizens-issues groups has organized to fight the FTA. The 
	proposed remedy of the labor coalition is to raise Mexican 
	wages and standards as part of an agreement.1 The issue is 
	placed in the broader context in which low-wage strategies of 
	producing in the third world are identified as a key 
	destructive force in the living standard of American workers.2 
	The coalition has paid virtually no attention (as labor has 
	always failed to do) to domestic adjustment programs. 
		The controversy surrounding the proposed FTA with 
	Mexico is misplaced. Free trade with Mexico cannot be a 
	panacea for all US problems, nor will it create "an economic 
	and social disaster for US workers and their communities" as 
	argued by the AFL-CIO.
		Any job losses are bad news at a time where real wages 
	are depressed and employment at best stagnant, but it must not 
	become an argument for stopping a good move in trade policy. 
	We accept and indeed applaud competition as the key driving

	force responsible for raising the standard of living in the 
	home economy and we recognize in looking at Eastern Europe 
	that lack of competition is responsible for the desperate 
	state of their economies. Even if trade liberalization 
	inevitably causes some dislocation, that must not mesmerize us 
	into maintaining the status quo for poor jobs. It is bad trade 
	policy, however, to keep workers and their children in poor 
	jobs and even pervert protection to the point where we attract 
	immigrants to perform this work. We should not let go of 
	competition. Of course, displaced workers should get 
	adjustment programs, skill building and education to help them 
	get into good jobs.
		Labor opposes the FTA because opening in their 
	experience focuses on Japan and developing economies which 
	have participated in successive GATT trade liberalization 
	rounds without much visible effect on their openness, thus 
	creating a sharply biased competition. Labor is right on that 
	score and should urge remedies in our trade relations with 
	Japan. But that has no bearing on the proposed free trade 
	agreement with Mexico.
		Democracy, workers' rights, safety and environmental 
	standards are obvious issues on the political agenda of 
	modern, open economies. A Free Trade Agreement supports 
	modernization in Mexico and thus nurtures these objectives. It 
	will also help raise wage levels in Mexico, back to their 1980 
	level and beyond. By contrast, trade restriction here must 
	mean even more poverty there; and with more poverty there will 
	be fewer rights and political radicalism, neither of which is 
	in the American interest.
		US business groups strongly support the FTA. Their 
	motive is that a more open Mexico will be a stable and more 
	prosperous Mexico. They instinctively support market-oriented 
	reform but they also see good business prospects.
		The Mexican government views the FTA as a major 
	driving force in making reform more irreversible,m thus 
	enhancing confidence and fostering the regflow of capital. 
	They also believe that with the risk of US protectionism 
	always around the corner, an FTA provides far stronger 
	safeguards of market access. The Mexican opposition has come 
	rather late to the issue, arguing that an FTA must not become 
	a cheap-labor development strategy. They have not offered a 
	picture of how an alternative strategy might lead to high 
	wages, but they have been careful not to position themselves 
	against an FTA since that might fit poorly into the Mexican 
	consensus that at present broadly welcomes modernization.
		Democracy, workers' rights, safety and environmental 
	standards are obvious issues on the political agenda of 
	modern, open economies. A Free Trade Agreement supports 
	modernization in Mexico and thus nurtures these objectives. It 
	will also help raise wage levels in Mexico, back to their 1980 
	level and beyond. By contrast, trade restriction here must 
	mean even more poverty there; poverty in turn fosters 
	political radicalism, which is not in the American interest.

		Beyond macroeconomics the section focus on the 
	structural adjustment in three areas: privatization, 
	deregulation and trade reform. The latter is particularly 
	important in that it demonstrates the sharp growth in US trade 
	with Mexico.  The dramatic effect of recovery and opening 
	measures in Mexico on our exports is already amply 
	demonstrated by the experience of the past three years.(See 
	Figure). 
		The section also offers some estimates of capital 
	flight since this relevant to fleshing out the positive 
	scenario of an FTA.
	
	CHAPTER 3 THE COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF AN FTA
		A free trade agreement with Mexico would represent a 
	significant step in focusing trade policy on creating more and 
	better jobs. Most of the work in improving the standard of 
	living must come from education, skill building and research, 
	but trade policy can contribute by opening and strengthening 
	markets for our export industries.  Except possibly in the 
	case of Japan or some Asian countries, increased market access 
	will inevitably require that we also must give in on remaining 
	protection at home. More and better jobs therefore come at the 
	price of more competition for protected industries and they 
	are sure to cause some losses of employment and wage pressure 
	in uncompetitive sectors. 
		Concerns about the effect of free trade on US jobs 
	focus on the low level of Mexican labor cost. Numbers such as 
	61 cents an hour are routinely cited. Of course, Mexican labor 
	costs are far higher than that even if they are low by 
	comparison with the US. Moreover, even with these low labor 
	costs, a move to free trade stands no chance of having major 
	effects on the US economy at large or on manufacturing.

		Further Mexican wage data are shown in Table 4. They 
	reveal, of course, that Mexican labor cost is low relative to 
	the United States. But the facts are not quite the 51 cents an 
	hour that is so often quoted.

	Associates)
	
		Puerto Rico with an average wage of $ 5.70 in 
	manufacturing has not destroyed manufacturing in the 
	continental United States, nor has the free trade agreement 
	with Israel where hourly compensation is half that in the 
	United States.
	
	Employment Effects:	Three factors support the assertion 
	that an FTA with Mexico cannot plausibly bring major harm and 
	is very likely to be beneficial. First, Mexico is very small 
	relative to the US. Any significant increase in Mexican 
	exports (measured on the US scale) would increase labor 
	requirements and wages in Mexico dramatically and thereby 
	squash competitiveness. 
			Second, although Mexican labor costs are low 
	relative to those in the US, these labor costs also reflect a 
	low level of productivity and in some areas such as textiles 
	the very low quality of output. The quality factor especially 
	is a major obstacle to a dramatic development of Mexican 
	exports.
			Third, the United States is a very open 
	economy. Competition from abroad is not a threat but a 
	complete reality. Protection continues only in a few sectors, 
	not across the board in all lines of activity. Moreover, 
	Mexico enjoys already a privileged position both as a result 
	of the GSP and more importantly as a consequence of the 
	maquila program which exempts reimports from US duties except 
	for the Mexican value added component. The combination of 
	factors reduces the extra impact of US trade liberalization to 
	a few sectors and to a total effect that have simply no chance 
	of amounting to much in terms of aggregate employment or 
	output. 
		Some idea of the net employment effects of an FTA can 
	be gained from an examination of the past few years.	Table 
	5 shows the developments of US-Mexican nonoil trade since 
	1986. The swing in our net exports is $6,809 billion. A rough 
	rule of thumb (developed by Jeff Faux's Economic Policy 
	Institute) translates an extra $1 million net exports into 30 
	new jobs. With this benchmark the swing in our trade balance 
	with Mexico since 1986 means 144,510 extra jobs in the United 
	States. Without the Mexican trade opening and recovery (and 
	whatever caused Mexico to shift to a deficit) we would have 
	today 144,510 less jobs.

		This demonstration runs a bit counter to the folklore 
	that Mexico is cutting our throat. Note that if one used a 
	different benchmark, say 20 jobs per $1 million exports we 
	would have less job creation but still an impressive 96,180 
	extra jobs.
		The next step is to ask what would happen if Congress 
	decided in favor of an FTA with Mexico. In my judgment that 
	would mean a strong stabilization of the Mexican macroeconomy 
	-- more confidence that reforms would not be reversed, less 
	risk of a confidence crisis, capital flight and exchange rate 
	crises. With a gain in confidence part of Mexican flight 
	capital -- in my estimate between $60 and 100 billion are 
	parked offshore in Miami or Switzerland-- would return. 
	Availability of foreign exchange would allow the financing of 
	normal trade deficits. 
		Judging from the experience of developing countries 
	that do have financing I would expect a deficit in Mexican 
	trade of 2 percent of their GNP or $6-8 billion in the mid-
	90s. The shift from the current position to these deficits 
	would translate into at least an extra 150,000 jobs in the 
	United States.
		These numbers refer to net job creation in the US. In 
	some industries (apparel, cheap glass, parts) there would be 
	an increase in imports. In other industries including upper 
	level cars, chemicals, textiles there would be a major rise in 
	exports. Accordingly there will be some adjustment problem, 
	but we will gain good jobs and will lose some medium to poor 
	jobs. It is in this area that we need a major commitment to 
	retraining. 
		 Over time the market would solve the adjustment 
	problem but not in a way that is socially acceptable. For this 
	reason, I believe a successful FTA needs to have two 
	components to address this problem, First, a very substantial 
	phase-in period say 10 years or even 15 for industries 
	adversely impacted. For the phase-in period we can 
	differentiate across industries and thus implicitly lighten 
	substantially the adjustment problem. Second, there needs to 
	be a major commitment of attention and resources to retraining 
	and skill building.
	
	Sectoral Impacts: A FTA will create more and better jobs, but 
	in the process of doing so, some jobs are almost certain to be 
	lost. The accompanying Table reports the key sectors where 
	employment impacts can be expected.

       		The table shows that Mexico still has significant 
       protection in key areas where the United States can as a result 
       expect to score export growth. This includes specifically 
       electronic equipment, automotive products, steel and textiles. In 
       the automobile industry a major restructuring could be expected, 
       though not one that would harm the United States.3 The US textile 
       sector is an example of an industry that has already demonstrated 
	_______________________________
	3See J.Womack "North American Integration in the Motor Vehicle Sector: 
	Logic and Consequences." Mimeo, MIT, June 1990.
       its ability to compete very effectively in Mexico. In 1989, and 
       more so in 1990, the United States ran a bilateral trade surplus 
       with Mexico in textiles and apparel. The key to understanding 
       this is to look  at quality, not only at wages. In the quality 
       perspective, the US is to Mexico, what Japan is to the US.
       		Since the United States  does continue to protect 
       certain sectors with high duties and nontariff barriers, a FTA 
       would open these areas to Mexican competition. Interestingly, the 
       USITC identifies only horticulture and inexpensive household 
       glass products as the areas where significant import increases 
       must be expected. The explanation, once more, is that the United 
       States is already substantially open to competition from low cost 
       countries and even more so to Mexico. In automobiles, for 
       example, the maquila program offers Mexico the opportunity to 
       compete in the US.
       		To the extent that import increases can be expected in 
       an area such as apparel, part of the extra imports will mostly 
       displace sales by low cost producers in Asia. In part it will 
       also reflect the result of US textile exports to Mexico which 
       raises the quality of Mexican apparel to the levels required for 
       the US market.
       		The upshot of this discussion is that trade 
       liberalization will give rise to increased imports, but that 
       there is no plausible alarm scenario. Moreover, going beyond the 
       particular loss of sensitive industries, trade creation induced 
       by the FTA will produce new good jobs. It will cost primarily bad 
       jobs or jobs that, in any event, are under threat from world 
       competition.
       		The maquila program has been cited as a major source of 
       US job losses in the 1980s and a FTA is interpreted as a vast 
       maquila program. But the fact is that the maquila program is 
       quantitatively small -- less than one third of a percent of US 
       manufacturing GNP.
       		 To the extent that a FTA reinforces confidence in 
       Mexico's modernization, as it already has started doing, flight 
       capital will return to Mexico and foreign direct investment will 
       grow. The availability of external capital until now has been a 
       severe constraint on growth and on investment in Mexico. With 
       modernization reinforced by a FTA, lack of capital will largely 
       disappear as a serious problem and Mexico will resume trade 
       deficits as appropriate for developing countries. Because the 
       United States is Mexico's chief supplier, Mexican growth and 
       deficits become a source of increases in US employment. Assuming 
       that Mexico runs a trade deficit of 2 percent of GNP, US job 
       creation over the next 5 years could be as high as 150,000. Even 
       larger numbers are quite possible because a FTA gives us 
       privileged access. 
       It has been asserted that an FTA could appreciably reduce the 
       standard of living of 70 percent of the American working 
       population. Is that a plausible prediction?
       		Harmful effects of an FTA will result primarily in the 
       manufacturing sector. Manufacturing employment in the United 
       States is only 15 percent of total employment. Assuredly not all 
       manufacturing workers will suffer a set back even under extreme 
       conditions. Thus the 70 percent assertion is extremely remote 
       from what can occur. 
       		In fact, in the extreme situation  where all workers in 
       the industries listed in Table 7 were to be hurt even then only 
       4.2 percent of all working Americans would be set back. In 
       conclusion, the 70 percent number is entirely indefensible.

       		An adverse competitive effect for some firms and workers 
       in industries such as inexpensive household glass, apparel though 
       not textiles or in some automobile parts industries is likely. 
       But that does not mean firms will go bankrupt and workers will 
       have to take massive cuts. For most firms it means a 
       restructuring toward higher value added and higher quality so 
       that they can remain competitive. A substantial phase-in period 
       for the FTA helps support this adjustment and implies that jobs 
       and ultimately wages will become better. Continued protection 
       removes pressure for adjustment and guarantees maximum 
       vulnerability should a sudden opening occur.
       
       Relevance of the European Experience: How do US-Mexico 
       compensation differentials compare to those inside Europe. 
       Specifically, is the proposed FTA with Mexico in any way 
       comparable to Greece, Portugal, and Spain joining the Common 
       Market?
       Table 8 shows that for the Germany:Portugal comparison the wage 
       relation is broadly the same as for the US:Mexico case.

       	 Spain's wages, however are almost half the German wage. But, of 
       course, the absolute difference between US and Mexican wages is 
       not very different from that between German and Spanish wages. 
       Spain's relative wage advantage has attracted some automobile 
       investment and also other industries. But it surely has not 
       undermined employment in Germany. On the contrary, Spanish 
       imports have grown far more rapidly than exports.
       		It is interesting to note that the merger of East and 
       West Germany involves a situation where the East German wage is 
       one third that in West Germany. For Hungary, Poland or 
       Czechoslovakia the wage relation is far more extreme and yet 
       these countries are expected to gain free trade access to the 
       European Common Market.
       		The experience in the European Common Market does not 
       suggest that massive dislocation occurred as a result of opening 
       to countries with half the wages of say Germany. The 
       comprehensive report Social Europe (Special edition of European 
       Economy, 1990) documents in detail the competitive problems of 
       various countries. It makes clear that the massive losses of 
       particular industries feared in he US-Mexican case simply did not 
       occur. Nor is there the slightest evidence of industry flight to 
       low wage locations. The quality dimension and sheer inertia 
       remain quite obviously important aspects of location. 
       		These findings are directly relevant to the United 
       States experience. If cheap labor were the only concern, all 
       production would move to China where wages are so low that they 
       easily cover the extra transport costs.
       
       Foreign Investment in Mexico: Investment in Mexico by Asian or 
       European firms should not be considered an unqualified 
       disadvantage of a FTA. Clearly, such investment will be motivated 
       to a large extent by the desire to build up an export base to the 
       US market and as such seems threatening. But for the most part 
       the goods come anyway, whether it be from Thailand or from Korea 
       and Japan. 
       		The penetration of our market by imports from Asia is 
       already a fact, the only question is whether, at the margin, 
       shifting the production from Asia to Mexico is in our interest. 
       And here the answer is clearly yes. Mexican workers spend a far 
       larger share of their income on our goods and hence we have an 
       interest in their having good jobs at good wages. 
       	It is understood, of course, that import content provisions 
       would apply. Location of Asian plants in Mexico cannot simply be 
       a means of circumventing US trade restrictions by performing 
       negligible assembly tasks in Mexico. The experience in Europe 
       with certificates of origin demonstrates that while 
       administratively cumbersome, it is by no means overwhelming.
       		 The argument used for Asian producers goes in the same 
       way for US firms. Co-production with Mexican labor is far better, 
       from the point of view of US labor, than losing and entire 
       operation to Asia or other locations. In many industries it is 
       today totally implausible to produce goods fully with labor 
       priced at the US level; foreign production is far too cost 
       competitive. Co-production with Mexico represents by a wide 
       margin the lesser of the two evils. In fact, the cost reducing 
       effects may well be important enough to allow higher US wages 
       and, at the same time, increased US competitiveness at home and 
       abroad. 
       
       CHAPTER 4  A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT AND MULTILATERALISM
       		In the postwar period the United States has invariably 
       favored an open world economy. Successive GATT rounds have opened 
       markets, at least across the Atlantic. In Europe, on a parallel 
       track to GATT, the Common Market has pursued an aggressive 
       project of regional integration with unquestioned benefits. The 
       United States has so far done little to exploit the parallel 
       track. Free trade with Mexico offers an important market opening 
       for the 1990s and beyond. The focus must shift from seeing trade 
       as a threat to viewing it as an opportunity for jobs and profits. 
        			 
       		US trade policy should aggressively seek freer trade. 
       Specifically two objectives should be pursued: First, to roll 
       back the increasing protectionism through nontariff barriers at 
       home; and second, to secure market opening abroad and forestall 
       the emergence of trade blocks harmful to US exports. We need to 
       review our objectives and the available instruments but 
       unfortunately in the public policy debate the line has been drawn 
       in an unproductive manner. Commitment to the Gatt-process has 
       become an objective in itself and an overriding objection to 
       bilateral initiatives, even those that are plainly within the 
       GATT rules and actively practiced in Europe.
       		Active trade policy is portrayed as if there were only 
       two options: the status quo of "GATT and the open, multilateral 
       system" (which in fact is neither quite open nor uniformly  
       multilateral) and "managed trade" (the Gatt-is-Dead crowd), with 
       no ground in between. Anyone arguing for bilateral liberalization 
       falls in the crossfire between protectionists who see the risks 
       for vulnerable industries (and never see the potential of extra 
       exports) and multilateralists who fear for the process. Not 
       surprisingly the debate in black-and-white terms has failed to 
       convince anyone and has kept off the table productive options 
       that assure freer trade.
       		 The policy debate has been hostile to bilateralism. Few 
       among the protagonists of the status quo ask of the GATT process 
       where the gains will be and when they come, if at all -- 
       negotiations take a decade or more. The beneficial effects of the 
       status quo are taken for granted and the only counterfactual is a 
       world without trade. Violations of the open trading system by 
       Japan are played down by arguing that Japan is "already" opening 
       up. Bilateralism practiced abroad, as in the Europe 92 
       initiative, is welcomed, even if the same policy used by the US 
       is seen as a threat to the system and the process. Any bilateral 
       proposition is presumed subversive and argued to death on grounds 
       of impracticality, political unfeasibility, here or abroad, 
       insignificance of effects or on principle.	
       		 Bilateralism connotes discriminatory trade practices 
       such as Imperial Preferences or the Schacht agreements of the 
       1930s and these were just as disturbing as the US tariff. The 
       notion of aggressive policy offends in a world where negotiation, 
       balance and rules -- diplomacy rather than bully-thy-neighbor -- 
       are supposed to reign. The established view, and certainly the 
       establishment view, is that bilateralism is a very bad idea, 
       indeed. In fact, if there are two dirty words in international 
       trade diplomacy they are "aggressive" and "bilateral". Unilateral 
       action, associated with Smoot-Hawley and the implosion of world 
       trade in the 1930s considered worst; on the scale from 1 to 100, 
       bilateral is not far behind. The liberal trading system, in this 
       view, is fragile and might not survive the challenge of a result-
       oriented trade strategy. And if the system suffers, who can be 
       sure that there is not a return to the 1930s with pervasive 
       impediments, collapsing trade and a world depression?
       		 The disdain is not warranted.	Open bilateralism (or 
       plurilateralism, used here interchangeably) offers such a 
       possibility.  Bilateralism got a bad name when it was an 
       instrument for restricting trade, but it can also be used in the 
       opposite direction, as an effective instrument for securing more 
       open trade. Moreover, if the system is open in the sense of 
       allowing conditional MFN access, a bilateral initiative can 
       become a vehicle for freer trade on a multilateral basis. The 
       case for aggressive bilateralism made here is to be interpreted 
       as a policy option that pushes the world economy toward freer 
       trade, complementing the GATT process where it still heads in 
       that direction or filling a vacuum in the quest for freer trade 
       in those areas where GATT has tacitly accepted the status quo or 
       even a slide into protectionism.
       		Bilateralism has an unnecessarily bad name and that a 
       more forceful trade posture (as exemplified by the Super 301 
       remedy and free trade areas) is altogether desirable. The gains 
       from the multilateral approach in the past have been significant 
       and are not in question; but the pace at which the process 
       delivers extra gains is slowing down and the liberal trading 
       system is eroding  Moreover, trade policy initiatives in Europe 
       and in Asia, are working quite possibly to the detriment of US-
       located production. In such an environment a search for more 
       effective US trade policy assumes special importance. To reap the 
       real income gains that freer trade can offer the US must not be 
       blocked by the now relatively unproductive GATT process, but 
       rather should move ahead or aside or any way required to overcome 
       the growing tendency toward trade restriction at home and abroad.
       		 To be sure. in some areas such as intellectual property 
       or services the multilateral approach still holds a lot of 
       promise.  But in the trade area aggressive bilateralism is not 
       incompatible with the objective of a world economy that is more 
       open. To the contrary, the increasing tendency to restrict trade 
       by nontariff barriers and VRAs needs to be reversed.
       
       A US Trade Block Strategy:	Concerns about pursuing the 
       bilateral (or plurilateral route) are to some extent fears about 
       the dynamics of the world trade game. If the US were to pursue a 
       bilateral route and set up a preferential trade blocks, would not 
       there be a risk of the formation of other, competing blocks? And 
       if that were to happen, could one be certain that there would not 
       be a 1930s style decline in world trade?  
       		The opposition to plurilateral approaches is thus more 
       than anything a reaction to the untried. But it also seems that 
       the principle of bilateralism is far more offensive and readily 
       challenged than any particular implementation, and more so when 
       it is suggested for the case of the US than anywhere else. The 
       principle of multilateralism and the liberal trading system is so 
       sacred because the US sees itself as the custodian of a policy 
       tradition that it helped create in the 1930s. And other countries 
       which routinely infringe have, of course, a vested interest in 
       the US naivete. This objective should be pursued by building a US 
       trade block based on conditional MFN.
       		There are several reasons why the US should actively 
       pursue a strategy of forming free trade areas.	The first 
       argument is that Europe (and seemingly Japan) are doing the same 
       already. The Europe 92 initiative highlights that tariff cutting 
       is not enough to promote free trade; in fact the agenda of 
       completing the internal market draws attention to the pervasive 
       nontariff obstacles to the free movement of goods. The completion 
       of that project has, of course, adverse effects on production 
       located outside the union. Specifically it reduces the demand for 
       EC imports, shifting that demand to inside sources. The result is 
       in all likelihood a deterioration of outsiders' terms of trade 
       relative to the union.
       		Much public discussion has focused on the risk of a 
       fortress Europe policy. That is certainly not a foregone 
       conclusion. But even without such a policy there are definitely 
       repercussion effects on outsiders. These arise directly from the 
       increased competitiveness of internal supply locations. In fact, 
       the EC in their report forecast a growth of intra-European output 
       and trade combined with a 7-10 percent decline in imports extra-
       EC outside sources.
       		A further reason for a trade block strategy concerns the 
       favorable dynamics of a wider area. In Europe the internal market 
       project has turned out to be a source of investment, shifting the 
       mood from Eurosclerosis to Europhoria. Investment to take part in 
       the project is running high, both from inside and outside the EC. 
       In fact, US multinationals are gearing up to invest in Europe not 
       only because of the growth prospects and the increased locational 
       efficiency, but also because of a latent risk of content 
       protection.
       		A trade block strategy can also be used as a means of 
       rolling back protection. Having already reduced tariffs to very 
       low levels, and having an open, competitive and deregulated 
       market, the US has little to offer as a temptation for 
       prospective partners. But there are two clear items left: one is 
       the exemption for partners from any existing non-tariff barriers 
       and the other is the exemption from future protection.
       
       Regionalism: An FTA with Mexico should ultimately be a means of 
       bringing prosperity to Central America and the Caribbean. One 
       channel is immediate:	If Mexico prospers, Central America will 
       benefit. Mexican authorities already have started taking an 
       active hand in the economic stabilization of Central America and 
       much more can be expected.  The United States shares in this 
       stabilization: enhanced political stability and security in the 
       region and reduced pressure of immigration are clearly in the 
       national interest.
       		The example of Europe deserves far more attention in our 
       design of trade policy. The core countries of the Common Market 
       have systematically reached out to the periphery to spread 
       prosperity and stability. Bringing Spain, Greece or Portugal into 
       the Common Market is no different from a FTA with Mexico. And the 
       discussion now with Eastern Europe serves much the same purpose. 
       Unless the periphery has trade access there will be no 
       investment. Without investment, jobs will be poor and the 
       pressure for migration enormous.
       		Mexico is recognizing these realities on her own border 
       in the South, responding to the dramatic decline in living 
       standards in Central America, notably in Nicaragua. Mexico has 
       now started filling the leadership vacuum, helping stabilize the 
       region. A rising tide raises all ships; a prosperous Mexico will 
       be a powerful shock absorber for us and a great help in nurturing 
       economic stability and prosperity in a region that is too close 
       to neglect but, except for communist threats, too small to draw 
       much of our attention. 
       		But there is another channel: ultimately we should bring 
       Central America and the Caribbean fully into the FTA. The best 
       means to do so is application of a conditional moist favored 
       nation treatment.
       
       
       CHAPTER 5 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
       Here are some of the findings and conclusions expected to be 
       reached:
       
       ù		Today the United States faces an unusual 
       opportunity to implement an outward looking trade policy with 
       Mexico. Looking for modernization as the way out of a difficult 
       economic situation, Mexico today is open to far reaching trade 
       reform. If we miss this opportunity, we are bound to fail 
       building an important Western Hemisphere trade and investment 
       block in the 1990s.
       
       ù Congress should sustain the fast track authority without which 
       a meaningful free trade agreement cannot be arrived at.
       
       ù Trade policy should create good jobs rather than focusing 
       primarily on the protection of bad jobs. Free trade with Mexico 
       represents a step in the direction of enlarging US export 
       markets. Because the US is already wide open to world 
       competition, and especially to Mexico, further bilateral trade 
       liberalization cannot have dramatic dislocation effects but will 
       on balance create better jobs in the US.
       
       ù By fostering confidence in Mexico, an FTA will help mobilize 
       the return of flight capital to Mexico. Availability  of 
       financing will allow Mexico to 
       
       ù The US urgently needs a serious adjustment assistance program. 
       The political fight over an FTA may present an unusual 
       opportunity to make headway on this issue.
       
       ù	If we are seriously concerned about the standard of 
       living in Mexico, and about democratization, we cannot escape the 
       recognition that a thriving, open market economy will raise 
       wages, create individual freedom, decentralize political power 
       and allow people to organize around local issues. If Mexico 
       prospers, it will in a far better position to take up costly but 
       urgent measures on safety standards at the work place and the 
       environment.
       
       ù	In discussing standards abroad we must not be tempted to 
       make Mexican producers uncompetitive. The object is to spread 
       prosperity at an affordable pace. It will take a long time before 
       Mexico will look like the United States, but we can start making 
       some headway. 
       		There is also an urgent need to reinforce regional and 
       North American environmental policies. This should largely be 
       handled separately from the FTA discussion, but at the same time. 
       Agreements might be expected to phase in stricter Mexican 
       standards by requiring new plants to abide by US environment 
       standards, while existing plants might have say 12 years to 
       adjust. 
       
       ù If Mexico prospers, Central America will benefit. Mexican 
       authorities already have started taking an active hand in the 
       economic stabilization of Central America and much more can be 
       expected.  The US shares in this stabilization because of 
       enhanced political stability and hence security in the region and 
       because of reduced pressure of immigration.
       
       ù At this stage it has become very expensive to turn back on a 
       free trade agreement. In Mexico the idea of trade opening has 
       become a corner stone 
       of the economic modernization strategy. The US has every interest 
       in supporting Mexico's example that with sensible policies 
       countries throughout Latin America could return to prosperity. 
       Turning our back on trade opening means inviting a resurgence of 
       protectionism not only in Mexico but throughout Latin America and 
       beyond. 
       		Turning our back on trade opening means inviting a 
       resurgence of protectionism not only in Mexico but throughout 
       Latin America and beyond. Going back on the FTA with Mexico would 
       send signals to the world economy far worse than the recent 
       failure of the Uruguay Round.
